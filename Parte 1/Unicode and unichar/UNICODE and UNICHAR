UNICODE and UNICHAR
The text that you see on the screen is stored in the computer as numbers. There is a mapping between these numbers and the character that gets displayed. This mapping is
called Unicode. Sometimes in Excel it is useful to be able to explore this mapping â€” perhaps to investigate an unusual character, or even to generate one!
For example, the letter A is character 65. You can test this in Excel by using =UNICODE("A"). To go the other way you can use =UNICHAR(65). This can be useful if you want
to type a character that is not on your keyboard. The non-breaking space is character 160. To convert non-breaking spaces to regular spaces you could use 
=SUBSTITUTE(A1,UNICHAR(160)," ").

These functions were introduced in Excel 2013 for Windows and Excel 2011 for Mac. In previous versions you have the CODE and CHAR functions. These work similarly to 
UNICODE and UNICHAR but the codes that they use are dependent on the computer operating system and language that you are using. We recommend using UNICODE and UNICHAR
whenever possible.

Try =UNICHAR(128512) (this may only work in more recent versions of Excel). If you have a recent version of Excel you can download this Unicode explorer. It will allow
you to look at a few of the interesting characters available in Unicode, and also demonstrates some of the formula techniques recently introduced to Excel.
